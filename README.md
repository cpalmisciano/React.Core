# React.Core
ASP.Net MVC Core / ReactJS sample

01/07/2019
This is a sample solution starting with a plain ASP.Net MVC Core app hosted in IIS for debugging (React00).<br/>
The next project adds authentication leveraging DI with a UserManager, and adds a couple of areas (React01).<br/>
React02 adds a React.Common entities to secure the areas (Authorize) and plays with some UI features to improve basic responsive design.<br/>
React03 adds the React layer using Webpack to create separate SPAs, 1 for the root level and 1 for each area.<br/>
It also shows the use of common React components (table/grid and tabs).<br/>
React04 adds AJAX calls to populate a grid.<br/>
